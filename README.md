# Retirement-Savings-Calculator
Purpose / Motivation

Retirement planning is crucial for financial security, but it can be challenging due to the need for accurate savings forecasts and an understanding of how different investment strategies impact long-term outcomes. The Retirement Savings Calculator aims to simplify this process by providing a tool that helps individuals project their retirement savings based on current investments, annual contributions, and expected rates of return. This tool will offer users valuable insights into how their savings will grow over time and the effects of various investment strategies, enabling them to make more informed decisions about their retirement.

Summary of Development 

The Retirement Savings Calculator will be developed using Python and will allow users to input the following:
•	Current Savings: Initial amount saved for retirement.
•	Annual Contributions: Amount added each year until retirement.
•	Expected Return Rate: Users can select from different investment strategies (conservative, balanced, aggressive), each offering different return rates.
•	Years Until Retirement: Time horizon until the user plans to retire.
Based on these inputs, the calculator will provide:
•	Final Retirement Savings: Projected savings at retirement age.
•	Post-Retirement Balance: The amount left after accounting for expected retirement expenses and taxes.
•	Savings Growth Visualization: A graph illustrating the growth of savings over time.
•	CSV Report Generation: The option to export the savings summary and projections as a CSV file.
